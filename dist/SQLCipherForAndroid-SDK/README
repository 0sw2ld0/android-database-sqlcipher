CURRENT TESTED PLATFORM SUPPORT

Android 2.1 (SDK Level 7)
Android 2.2 (SDK Level 8)
Android 2.3 (SDK Level 9)
Android 2.3.3 (SDK Level 10)
Android 3.0 (SDK Level 11)
Android 3.1 (SDK Level 12)
Android 3.2 (SDK Level 13)

HOW TO

1) Update your import path from android.database to info.guardianproject.database and you are almost there!

2) then when you open your database, just pass a variable argument to the open database method with your password:
	
	SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context
	SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase("thisismysecret"):

and you are secured!

You will need to implement a passcode entry user interface to your application, as well. The longer the passcode, the better.
